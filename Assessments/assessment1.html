	<p>I am a 23-year-old musician, born in Leeds up in the UK, but I will always consider Australia to really be my home, after growing up in Perth.</p>
	<p>While living in the middle of Australia for a few years, I first picked up the guitar, which soon became a lifelong pursuit and eventually even lead to a contemporary music performance Bachelor's degree from a college near London, called the Academy of Contemporary Music.</p>
	<p>With that behind me, I've turned my sights towards IT and programming, a field I've always had a passing interest in, but now I'm taking a much bigger plunge into study to hopefully make this a true career option.</p>
