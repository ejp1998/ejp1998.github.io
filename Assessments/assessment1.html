	<p>I am a 23-year-old musician, born in Leeds up in the UK, but I will always consider Australia to really be my home, after growing up in Perth.</p>
	<p>While living in the middle of Australia for a few years, I first picked up the guitar, which soon became a lifelong pursuit and eventually even lead to a contemporary music performance Bachelor's degree from a college near London, called the Academy of Contemporary Music.</p>
	<p>With that behind me, I've turned my sights towards IT and programming, a field I've always had a passing interest in, but now I'm taking a much bigger plunge into study to hopefully make this a true career option.</p>

	<h1 id="Interest">Interest in IT</h1>

	<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
	<p>As a kid growing up, I was always more absorbed in books and computers than social activities, and this naturally led to an interest in the systems behind all the games and software I used on a daily basis. In my early years of high school, with nothing but a school-issued laptop, I found myself some introductory Python tutorials and learned the basics so I at least understood the general principles of software development, but never pursued it further - aside from occasional very brief sojourns into HTML, Lua, even a short-lived look at Javascript once upon a time.</p>
	<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
	<p>I found the Intro to IT/Programming RMIT courses through Open Universities, and it looked like they would be the most ideal fit for my current level of experience. The online nature of the courses meant that it would likely be less stressful than a more full-time, in-person course, which is good as I've previously had anxiety issues while studying full-time and this is a way for me to reacclimate first.</p>
	<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
	<p>Although I am primarily here to study the harder-science programming half of the two courses, I do also expect to gain a much richer cultural and social understanding of the role that IT continues to play in a rapidly evolving digital world.</p>

	<p>This posting by Blowfish Studios is asking for a junior-to-mid-level backend Node.JS developer. While the posting itself isn't overtly clear on the specific nature of the position (similar to many postings that I looked at), it can be inferred that as a game development studio looking for experience with React (a javascript UI tool), Docker (a platform for bundling code into self-contained apps), as well as an assortment of other tools such as CSS and HTML, the position will be a diverse range of game development tasks, primarily focused on scripting and probably some form of web design.</p>
	<p>Right now, although I have do have some prior experience with HTML and CSS (as you can see from this page!) it would not be nearly enough to consider myself comfortable, and certainly not <i>professional</i> with the software. I also haven't yet particularly probed into the realm of Javascript, which most of the required elements for this job posting seem to run on, like React and Node.JS, so in addition to delving more deeply into web design projects for HTML and CSS experience, I would likely need to study Javascript very indepth.</p>
	<p>In addition, though this particular job posting doesn't really ask for it, I think that along the way I should set up a professional Github page and fill it out with future projects, to help demonstrate both my familiarity with Git and with the required platforms/languages.</p>
	<p>Of course, while this position is full time, it is a junior/mid-level position at the end of the day. A position such as this is exactly what I'd need to really gloss up a resume for future employment in more senior positions, thereby making it easier and easier to find IT work - one of the things that has become quite clear after scrolling through postings on Seek.com is that many currently in-demand positions require multiple years of experience with a myriad different development environments. I'd want to do a role like this not only because it's a much better introduction to the field while being remote-friendly, but specifically because of how it could positively influence my future prospects.</p>
