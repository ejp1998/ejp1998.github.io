	<p>I am a 23-year-old musician, born in Leeds up in the UK, but I will always consider Australia to really be my home, after growing up in Perth.</p>
	<p>While living in the middle of Australia for a few years, I first picked up the guitar, which soon became a lifelong pursuit and eventually even lead to a contemporary music performance Bachelor's degree from a college near London, called the Academy of Contemporary Music.</p>
	<p>With that behind me, I've turned my sights towards IT and programming, a field I've always had a passing interest in, but now I'm taking a much bigger plunge into study to hopefully make this a true career option.</p>

	<h1 id="Interest">Interest in IT</h1>

	<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
	<p>As a kid growing up, I was always more absorbed in books and computers than social activities, and this naturally led to an interest in the systems behind all the games and software I used on a daily basis. In my early years of high school, with nothing but a school-issued laptop, I found myself some introductory Python tutorials and learned the basics so I at least understood the general principles of software development, but never pursued it further - aside from occasional very brief sojourns into HTML, Lua, even a short-lived look at Javascript once upon a time.</p>
	<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
	<p>I found the Intro to IT/Programming RMIT courses through Open Universities, and it looked like they would be the most ideal fit for my current level of experience. The online nature of the courses meant that it would likely be less stressful than a more full-time, in-person course, which is good as I've previously had anxiety issues while studying full-time and this is a way for me to reacclimate first.</p>
	<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
	<p>Although I am primarily here to study the harder-science programming half of the two courses, I do also expect to gain a much richer cultural and social understanding of the role that IT continues to play in a rapidly evolving digital world.</p>
